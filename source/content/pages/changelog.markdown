## In progress update
**Caveat**: These are potential updates that may or may not make it into
the next release or future releases. I'll do my best, but I can't guarantee
there won't be unforeseen issues that prevent me from getting these done.
* Updating from Ansible 1.9.4 to 2.0.1.0
* Evaluating whether to use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS instead of the current 14.04.
  May need to wait a few months for this one to shake out any bugs.

## September 2016 Update
* Updated images to match current UIs on cloud services
* Proofread, re-wrote, fixed typos and generally improved every chapter 
* **Under the covers**: moved to Prince to generate the PDFs, Pandoc for 
  ePubs and Kindlegen for .mobi
* *Chapter 3*
    * Clarified Ansible playbook creation instructions based on reader 
      feedback
    * Replaced dead resources with new ones that should be more relevant 
* *Chapter 4*
    * Updated Namecheap console screenshots to match their latest web
      user interface

## End of the Year Update - December 2015
* Pinned Ansible library to version 1.9.4 because 1.9.6 has a bug with the
  [Twilio module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/twilio_module.html) due 
  to a mistake in the merge that snuck in from a previous version.
  Ansible version 2.x will have a properly working Twilio module for future
  versions of the book.


## October 2015
* Incorporated reader feedback regarding confusing instruction wording in 
  the into the first several chapters.


## August 2015
* Small typo fixes and writing clean up for clarity based on initial 
  reader feedback.


## July 2015
* Initial public release. Woohoo!
