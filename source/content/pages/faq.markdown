These questions and answers will hopefully help you to decide if purchasing
The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments book is worth your time and money.
If your question does not appear below, tweet 
[@mattmakai](https://twitter.com/mattmakai) or email matthew.makai@gmail.com 
with your question and I will get it added to this page.


## How is this book different from the Full Stack Python website?
The book is entirely new content with specific step-by-step instructions
and explanations for performing deployments. When you read 
[Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/) you will understand
deployments at a high level, but will not know the exact commands to, for 
example, configure a web server like Nginx. 

The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments gives you all those commands and 
shows you how to deploy Python web applications manually and then shows you
how to automate those steps with Fabric and Ansible so you can repeat them
without re-typing the commands on subsequent deployments.



## What skill level is this book intended for?
The book is intended for people who have some basic experience building
Python web applications and have either never deployed their web apps
or only deployed to a platform-as-a-service like Heroku. The book lays out
every necessary step to perform the deployment and does not assume any
pre-existing knowledge about purchasing and provisioning virtual 
infrastructure for hosting.



## I just built my first Python web application and want to deploy it. Should I buy the book?
Yes. This book is written with you in mind and you will get a ton of value
out of it.



## I am very experienced with deploying Python web applications. Should I buy the book?
No. This book contains specific steps for deploying web apps intended for
people who have never done this type of work before.



## Do I need to have already built an application for this to be useful?
No, you do not need to have built your own application to deploy. The book 
uses the open source 
[Choose Your Own Adventure Presentations Flask web app](https://github.com/makaimc/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations)
as an example throughout each chapter. However, if you do already have an 
application you want to deploy, you will be able to follow along and use 
the book to deploy that app instead.
