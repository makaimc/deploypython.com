## What skill level is this book intended for?
The book is intended for people who have some basic experience building
Python web applications and have either never deployed their web apps
or only deployed to a platform-as-a-service like Heroku. The book lays out
every necessary step to perform the deployment and does not assume any
pre-existing knowledge about purchasing and provisioning virtual 
infrastructure for hosting.
