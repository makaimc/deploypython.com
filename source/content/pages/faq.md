These questions and answers will hopefully help you to decide if purchasing
The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments book is worth your time and money.
If your question does not appear below, tweet 
[@mattmakai](https://twitter.com/mattmakai) or email matthew.makai@gmail.com 
with your question and I will get it added to this page.


## What skill level is this book intended for?
The book is intended for people who have some basic experience building
Python web applications and have either never deployed their web apps
or only deployed to a platform-as-a-service like Heroku. The book lays out
every necessary step to perform the deployment and does not assume any
pre-existing knowledge about purchasing and provisioning virtual 
infrastructure for hosting.


## Do I need to have already built an application for this to be useful?
No, you do not need to have built your own application to deploy. The book 
uses the open source 
[Choose Your Own Adventure Presentations](https://github.com/makaimc/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations)
Flask web app as an example throughout each chapter. However, if you do
already have an application you want to deploy, you will be able to follow
along and use the book to deploy that app instead.
