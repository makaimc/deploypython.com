        <p>The content in The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments is 
           newly written just for this book. It works well either by itself
           or in combination with the material available on 
           <a href="http://www.fullstackpython.com/">Full Stack Python</a>.

        <h3>What's in the book?</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout the book you'll take an example open source Python 
            web application through a complete deployment on a virtual 
            private server. 
            In each chapter, we will first learn how to deploy the application 
            manually, to fully understand each step, then automate the steps
            with <a href="http://www.fabfile.org/">Fabric</a> and 
            <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>. We also set up
            a continuous integration server to automate the deployment
            process once we have our Ansible playbooks in place.
