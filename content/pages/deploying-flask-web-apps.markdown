## Book Change Log
### 2019
### April 
* Chapters 1-7 updated and released.
* Book now uses DigitalOcean instead of Linode.
* Fabric removed in favor of simplicity with Ansible for all configuration
  management.
* Revisions to entire introduction section.
* Changed the book title from "The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments"
  to "Deploying Flask Web Applications" to more accurately represent
  the content and future directions.
* Moved book generation to custom toolchain that uses Pelican, pandoc, 
  kindlegen, Prince and a bunch of Python and Bash scripts.


### Pre-2019 updates
* September 2016 edition: Major clarification text and 
  improvements to all chapters based on further reader feedback. Changed 
  from using Ulysses Mac app to Prince PDF generator, pandoc and Kindlegen 
  for ebook generation, which should allow for faster new edition releases. 
  Open sourced and released 
  [gitbook-code-highlighter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook-plugin-code-highlighter)
  on npm that was built for this book when I was trying to get gitbook working
  as the generation tool. Updated screenshots for Namecheap and other services.

* December 2015 edition: Clean up and clarifications on confusing sections 
  throughout chapters 4, 6, 7 and 10. A huge thank you to 
  [Zev Averbach](https://github.com/zevav) for his tweets and issue tickets on 
  GitHub that allowed me to reproduce some problems he had going through 
  several sections.

* August 2015 edition: Typo and link fixes throughout the book.

* First edition July 2015: Initial release.
