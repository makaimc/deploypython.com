## Editions List
2018-05-01: **May 2018 edition**. 



2016-09-08: **September 2016 edition**. Major clarification text and 
improvements to all chapters based on further reader feedback. Changed 
from using Ulysses Mac app to Prince PDF generator, pandoc and Kindlegen 
for ebook generation, which should allow for faster new edition releases. 
Open sourced and released 
[gitbook-code-highlighter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook-plugin-code-highlighter)
on npm that was built for this book when I was trying to get gitbook working
as the generation tool. Updated screenshots for Namecheap and other services.

2015-12-03: **December 2015 edition**. Clean up and clarifications on 
confusing sections throughout chapters 4, 6, 7 and 10. A huge thank you to 
[Zev Averbach](https://github.com/zevav) for his tweets and issue tickets on 
GitHub that allowed me to reproduce some problems he had going through 
several sections.
